# Advanced_ML_Telecom_Churn
Case Study submission for advanced ML Telecom Churn 

Business background 

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from ine operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.


Understanding and Defining Churn

There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - postpaid (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (customers pay/recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services).
In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know wether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily (e.g. someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and then intend to resume using the services again.)
Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical (and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the term 'churn' should be defined carefully. Also, prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe and North America.
This project is based on the Indian and Southeast asian market.

There are various ways to define churn, such as:
Revenue-based churn: 
Usage-based churn:
High-value Churn

Following steps were followed - 
 Data Understanding
 
 Exploratory Data Analysis
 
 Feature Engineering
 
Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)

Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modeling/feature engineering).

Derive new features if you need.

Train a variety of models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).

Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics.Â 

Finally, choose a model based on an evaluation metric with proper justification.
